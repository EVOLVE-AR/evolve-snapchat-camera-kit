The functions here are not the main feature of the library; they are additional functions that you can use.

## Getting Video Metadata

Here is the example code below that demonstrates how to extract the metadata of any video file:

```jsx
import { getMetadata } from 'react-native-snapchat-camera-kit';

const metadata = await getMetadata('video-path');
```

When you record a video using the library, this data is already provided.

### Metadata

```ts
interface VideoMetadata {
  /**
   * The path of the file.
   */
  path: string;

  /**
   * File size in bytes.
   */
  size: number;

  /**
   * The average framerate (in frames/sec).
   */
  frameRate: number;

  /**
   * Duration of the video in seconds.
   */
  duration: number;

  /**
   * Audio codec.
   *
   * @platform Android
   */
  audioCodec: string;

  /**
   * Video codec.
   *
   * @platform Android
   */
  videoCodec: string;

  /**
   * Video width.
   */
  width: number;

  /**
   * Video height.
   */
  height: number;
}
```
