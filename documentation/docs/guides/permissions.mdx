You need to ask necessary permissions before render the CameraKit component.

## Getting Permissions

Simply use the get functions to find out if a user has granted or denied permission before:

```jsx
import { CameraPermissionManager } from 'react-native-snapchat-camera-kit';

// ..

const cameraPermission =
  await CameraPermissionManager.getCameraPermissionStatus();
const microphonePermission =
  await CameraPermissionManager.getMicrophonePermissionStatus();
```

A permission status can have the following values:

- `authorized`: Your app is authorized to use said permission. Continue with using the `<DeepAR>` view.
- `not-determined`: Your app has not yet requested permission from the user. Continue by calling the request functions.
- `denied`: Your app has already requested permissions from the user, but was explicitly denied. You cannot use the request functions again, but you can use the [Linking API](https://reactnative.dev/docs/linking#opensettings) to redirect the user to the Settings App where he can manually grant the permission.
- `restricted`: (iOS only) Your app cannot use the Camera or Microphone because that functionality has been restricted, possibly due to active restrictions such as parental controls being in place.

## Requesting Permissions

Use the request functions to prompt the user to give your app permission to use the Camera or Microphone.

```jsx
import { CameraPermissionManager } from 'react-native-snapchat-camera-kit';

// ..

const cameraPermission =
  await CameraPermissionManager.requestCameraPermission();
const microphonePermission =
  await CameraPermissionManager.requestMicrophonePermission();
```

- `authorized`: Your app is authorized to use said permission. Continue with using the `<DeepAR>` view.
- `denied`: The user explicitly denied the permission request alert. You cannot use the request functions again, but you can use the [Linking API](https://reactnative.dev/docs/linking#opensettings) to redirect the user to the Settings App where he can manually grant the permission.
