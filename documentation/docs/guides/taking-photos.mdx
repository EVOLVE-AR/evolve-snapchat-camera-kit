To capture a photo using the Snapchat Camera Kit, you can take reference to below code:

```tsx
import React, { useRef } from 'react';
import { StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

import CameraKit from 'react-native-snapchat-camera-kit';

const App = () => {
  const ref = useRef<CameraKit>(null);

  const capturePhoto = () => {
    ref.current.takePhoto();
  };

  return (
    <React.Fragment>
      <CameraKit
        ref={ref}
        style={styles.camera}
        onPhotoTaken={(picture) => {
          // you can handle the picture here
        }}
      />
      <Button title="Capture Photo" onPress={capturePhoto} />
    </React.Fragment>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  camera: {
    flex: 1,
  },
});

export default App;
```

### Photo

```ts
interface Photo {
  /**
   * The path of the file.
   *
   * * **Note:** If you want to consume this file (e.g. for displaying it in an `<Image>` component), you might have to add the `file://` prefix.
   *
   * * **Note:** This file might get deleted once the app closes because it lives in the temp directory.
   */
  path: string;
}
```
